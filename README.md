Connecting the wires between the breadboard and the Arduino was straightforward.
Ensuring that the spacing and sequence of the wires seems to be very important as one adds a greater number of input and output devices.  Sequencing the wires, resistors, input and output devices with enough room and a logical progression so that connections can be tracked visually is important and something to keep in mind as I embark on future experiments.
